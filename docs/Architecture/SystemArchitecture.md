- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Secure authentication with JWT token management

**Key Features**:
- Dashboard interfaces for different user roles
- Election management tools for administrators
- Voting booth interface for voters
- Candidate management interface
- Face verification component for voter authentication

### 2. Backend API Server

**Technology**: Node.js, Express.js, JSON Web Tokens

**Responsibilities**:
- API endpoint handling for all system operations
- Authentication and authorization
- Business logic implementation
- Database interactions
- Blockchain transaction execution
- File upload handling

**Key Components**:
- **Controllers**: Handle business logic for different entities
- **Routes**: Define API endpoints and map them to controllers
- **Middleware**: Handle authentication, logging, error handling
- **Utils**: Utility functions including blockchain interactions
- **Models**: Database schema definitions

### 3. Database

**Technology**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM

**Responsibilities**:
- Store all system data except blockchain-verified transactions
- Maintain relationships between entities
- Support for complex queries
- Efficient data retrieval

**Key Collections**:
- **Users**: User accounts for all roles

## Data Flow

### Voter Registration Process

1. User submits registration form with personal details and uploads ID document
2. Backend validates input data and stores in database
3. Admin reviews registration and verifies documents
4. If approved, voter status is updated
5. Voter receives wallet credentials for blockchain voting

### Election Creation Process

1. Admin creates election with details (name, type, dates, etc.)
2. Backend stores election configuration in database
3. Admin associates candidates with the election
4. Admin starts the election when ready
5. Backend updates database and records election start on blockchain

### Voting Process

1. Voter logs in and selects an active election
2. System verifies voter eligibility
3. Voter completes face verification
4. Voter selects a candidate and casts vote using private key
5. Backend records vote in database
6. Vote is recorded on blockchain using voter's private key
7. Voter receives confirmation of successful vote

## Security Architecture

### Authentication

- JWT-based authentication with secure token storage
- Role-based access control for different user types
- Session management with token expiration

### Data Protection

- Password hashing with bcrypt
- HTTPS for all API communications
- Data validation on both client and server
- Sanitization of user inputs

### Blockchain Security

- Private key management for secure transactions
- Event monitoring for transaction verification
- Error handling for blockchain operations
- Fallback mechanisms for transaction failures

## Scalability Considerations

- Horizontally scalable backend architecture
- Database indexing for efficient queries
- Pagination for large data sets
- Optimized blockchain interactions to minimize gas costs
- Asynchronous processing for long-running operations

## Fault Tolerance

- Error handling for all operations
- Graceful degradation when blockchain is unavailable
- Database transaction management
- Retry mechanisms for failed operations
- Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

## Conclusion

The VoteSure system architecture provides a robust, secure platform for electronic voting by combining traditional web technologies with blockchain verification. The separation of concerns between components allows for maintainability and scalability, while the integration of blockchain ensures transparency and tamper-proof record-keeping for critical voting operations.
