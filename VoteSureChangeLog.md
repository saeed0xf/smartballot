# VoteSure Application Change Log

## Overview
This document summarizes the key changes made to the VoteSure election management system. This serves as a reference for understanding the system's evolution and current state.

## Core Issues Addressed

### 1. Candidate-Election Association Problems
- **Issue**: Candidates showing "Unknown Election" in UI
- **Resolution**: 
  - Updated `addCandidate` function to properly validate and set election references
  - Enhanced `getCandidatesByElectionId` to search by both election ID and type
  - Added candidate linking in `endElection` and `checkAndAutoEndElections` to ensure proper archiving

### 2. Archived Candidates Display
- **Issue**: Candidates for archived elections not displaying in the UI
- **Resolution**:
  - Improved `viewElectionCandidates` function in `ArchivedElections.jsx`
  - Added better fallback candidate loading
  - Enhanced error handling and empty state feedback

### 3. Blockchain Integration
- **Issue**: MetaMask prompt not appearing for election transactions
- **Resolution**:
  - Updated `startElectionOnBlockchain` and `endElectionOnBlockchain` to use `eth_sendTransaction`
  - Modified controller functions to extract and pass MetaMask address
  - Enhanced frontend to properly handle MetaMask connections

### 4. Voter Management Functionality
- **Issue**: 404 errors when trying to view voter details or approve/reject voters
- **Resolution**:
  - Fixed missing route for `/admin/voters/:voterId` to retrieve voter details
  - Updated route parameter names from `:id` to `:voterId` across voter-related routes to match controller expectations
  - Enhanced error handling for voter management operations

### 5. Voter ID Image Preview
- **Issue**: "Click to enlarge" functionality not working in voter details
- **Resolution**:
  - Replaced static text with interactive button component
  - Added proper event handlers for image preview modal
  - Enhanced image URL construction with better logging and validation
  - Improved error handling for image loading failures

### 6. MetaMask Authentication Error
- **Issue**: Login error "External transactions to internal accounts cannot include data" when trying to authenticate with voter wallet
- **Resolution**:
  - Changed authentication method from `eth_sendTransaction` to `personal_sign` in the `signMessage` function
  - Updated backend to verify signatures using `ethers.utils.verifyMessage`
  - This avoids MetaMask's restriction on sending data to your own address in transactions
  - Improved error handling and logging for authentication process

### 7. Face Verification for Voter Identity
- **Issue**: Need for reliable voter identity verification beyond traditional methods
- **Resolution**:
  - Created a dedicated AI module with face verification capabilities
  - Implemented a FastAPI backend with deepface for face recognition
  - Built a user-friendly web interface for comparing face images
  - Added support for both webcam capture and image upload
  - Implemented comprehensive error handling and detailed verification results
